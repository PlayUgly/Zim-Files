=== Automatic Variables ===
Automatic variables are set by make after a rule is matched. These include:
$@: the target filename.
$*: the target filename without the file extension.
$<: the first prerequisite filename.
$^: the filenames of all the prerequisites, separated by spaces, discard duplicates.
$+: similar to $^, but includes duplicates.
$?: the names of all prerequisites that are newer than the target, separated by spaces.
